# Storyteller with Langchain and GPT-3.5 Turbo

Welcome to the Storyteller project! Using the Langchain ü¶úÔ∏èüîó framework in conjunction with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo, we've created a captivating storytelling experience that breathes life into your ideas.

## Overview

Our Storyteller takes your initial concept and weaves it into a compelling narrative. It features multiple characters, each with their unique voices generated with ElevenLabs. To accomplish this, we employ Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify character names within the story. We also utilize a curated dataset to determine character genders, ensuring that the generated voices match their identities.
